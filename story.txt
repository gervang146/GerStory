Once upon a time, there was a cat. The cat was named Rat. All of his life, he believed that he was a rat. Nobody had ever clarify that he was a cat. Since everybody kept calling him Rat, he took it to heart and started to act like a rat. Rat had also adopted the living condition of a Rat and moved away from his parent's house. Believing that he is a rat, Rat's belief came true and before he knew it, he was able to do all the things that rats can do such as going through small holes on the wall or climbing house walls, and scavanging for food.

However, in a rainy day, Rat tried to find a shelter and unfortunately, he fell into a hole, where is a sweet home of several rats. Rats inside the hole are all scared about the Rat and tried their best to get rid of Rat. Rat tried to say hello to these rats but they just treated Rat as an enemy, which made Rat so sad.

But Rat made new friends.  He moved to tahiti and lived on the beach where he sipped on pina colladas.   When he met a british pelican named Ralph.  He and Ralph became good friends.  They went fishing and would often sit out and watch the stars together.  One day Rat asked Ralph what the meaning of life is.   Ralph responded... 

Ralph said the meaning of life is making good friends. So Rat still wanted to make friends with those rats. And he went back to the hole and told those rats that he would not hurt them. Finally, those rats accepted Rat, they ate rice together.

Then one day, Ralph told Rat about what he really is. "you are a cat," said Ralph. Rat couldn't believe what Ralph had said. Rat keeps on denying that he is a cat. Everything that he has ever known was lost to him. Rat became conflicted with his identity and has now believed that he has lost all purpose in life. Trying to think about his identity was too difficult so he went to the zoo. That is when Rat had a epiphany, "I know!, the easiest way out was right in front of my eyes all along," screamed Rat. He walked into the cage of tigers.
