Once upon a time, there was a cat. The cat was named Rat. All of his life, he believed that he was a rat. Nobody had ever clarify that he was a cat. Since everybody kept calling him Rat, he took it to heart and started to act like a rat. Rat had also adopted the living condition of a Rat and moved away from his parent's house. Believing that he is a rat, Rat's believe came true and before he knew it, he was also to do all the things that rats can do such as going through small holes on the wall or climbing house walls, or scavange for food.
